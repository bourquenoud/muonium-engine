#About
##Origin
A while ago I stared experimenting with 3D and graphics in general on PIC32, and wanted to make a game console with 3D capabilities. My console (somewhat) works, and I wanted to make a more structured code and open it for everyone to use 

##Why this name ?
*Muonium is an exotic atom made up of an antimuon(μ) and an electron(e) [...] muonium(μe)* (Wikipedia)

Micro (graphic) Engine -> μe -> Muonium. Yup. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
